				<h2>Color Theory</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Color theory was originally formulated in terms of three "primary" or "primitive" colors-red,
					yellow and blue (RYB)-because these colors were believed capable of mixing all other colors.
					Goethe's color wheel from his 1810 Theory of Colours The RYB primary colors became the foundation
					of 18th century theories of color vision,[citation needed] as the fundamental sensory qualities that
					are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments
					or dyes.</p>
				<br />
				<p>These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological
				color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues that are produced by
				color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color
				observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the Theory of Colours (1810) by the
				German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast (1839) by the French
				industrial chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. Charles Hayter published A New Practical Treatise on the Three
				Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information (London 1826), in which he
				described how all colours could be obtained from just three.</p>

				Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception
				is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors-red, green and blue violet (RGB)-modeled
				through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary
				colors in the differing responses to light by three types of color receptors or cones in the retina
				(trichromacy). On this basis the quantitative description of color mixture or colorimetry developed in
				the early 20th century, along with a series of increasingly sophisticated models of color space and color
				perception, such as the opponent process theory. Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically
				expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation
				in color mixtures of dyes, paints and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary
				for color photography.</p>
				<br />
				<p>As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible
				in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary colors most effective in inks
				or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by a
				black ink, known as the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the color
				of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color
				mixing with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that absorbed only one
				of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (−R+G+B), magenta only green (+R−G+B), and yellow
				only blue violet (+R+G−B). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant
				as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing
				certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples.</p>
				<br />
				<p>A wider range of color can
				be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in Pantone's Hexachrome
				printing ink system (six colors), among others. Munsell's color system represented as a three-dimensional
				solid showing all three color making attributes: lightness, saturation and hue. For much of the 19th century
				artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or was augmented by science books written
				for the lay public, in particular Modern Chromatics (1879) by the American physicist Ogden Rood, and early
				color atlases developed by Albert Munsell (Munsell Book of Color, 1915, see Munsell color system) and Wilhelm
				Ostwald (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by artists teaching or
				associated with the German Bauhaus, in particular Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Faber Birren and
				Josef Albers, whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color
				design principles.
